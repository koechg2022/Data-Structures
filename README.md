# Data-Structures

I wanted to get some practice with Data Structures in C++ so I made this simple implementation of a linked list type of data structure
using what I know from Java & Python. I tried to make this linked list work with a push & pop to negative indexes where the negative indexes are the 
last index of the linked list.

I was also able to add some color to the test result displays on Unix machines, but I wasn't able to get the same color on windows machines.

*NOTE*

On linux, the **clang++** compiler has been known to fail with importing the **<<vector>>** header (used for testing), however the **g++** compiler has worked well.
